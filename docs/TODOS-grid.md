### Transcript log: docs/transcripts-buffer/codex/codex-grid-unify-2025-12-31-1849.log
Please explain how the user can interact with the grid in the "Main App".



I want to implement a new "Left Click Mode" called "Smart". This mode should behave like the "Draw Cell" mode when the user hovers or clicks a cell and behave like the "Spawn Particle" mode when the user hovers or clicks an edge.
Please estimate the complexity and resulting architectural changes of implementing this new feature.

Please explain how in the existing modes hovering over a cell or an edge is detected? How does the hit test work exactly?


Please implement the new "Smart" "Left Click Mode" as I have described it before.
The precedence when both a cell and edge are within threshold is: edge wins when within threshold.
The thresholds for edge detection vs cell detection: please reuse the existing thresholds.
If anything is unclear please just ask.



Please give me a list of all Controls in the "Grid Controls" in the current order.

Please restructure the Grid Controls by grouping them into separate folders in this order:

"File"
  - Save to PNG (button)
  - Load from PNG (button)
"Grid"
  - Draw State selector (custom palette blade)
  - Grid Scale
  - Grid Type
  - Grid Width
  - Grid Height
  - Particle Speed
  - Edge Selection Rule
"GUI"
  - Palette
  - Edge Width
  - Edge Color
"Advanced"
  - Left Click Mode
  - Number of States
  - Show Coordinates
  - Visualize Edge Delta
  - Edge Palette

All folders except he "Grid" folder should be closed initially.



Please make the "Grid Scale" adjustable using the mouse wheel zoom in/out.



Some ux issues
* when using the scroll wheel for zooming the "Grid Scale" slider is not updated.
* the grid does not seem to be centered for grid types triangles and hexagons. (Squares and Cairo grids looks visually centered.)
* when changing the grid height or grid height please keep the cell data instead of setting all to 0 when the size of the grid changes.



Please create a new folder named "Particles" (initially open) right after "Grid" and move these two controls there:
  - Particle Speed
  - Edge Selection Rule



The two buttons don't need the redundant label. Please remove them.







# NEXT
* unify spawn particle and cell manipulation by either highlighting cell or edge ;)
* ask how it is now
* particle rule: keep approx distance from mouse cursor
* multiple rules as priority list with rules that cant be fullfilled skipping to the next
*

# UNUSED
New try with clean interface wenn tile editor fertig ist
Before we implement the new feature we need to refactor the way the grid interface works in the "Main App"






# INIT
Please analyze the following list of files and directories in the cwd. For directories please also analyze any subdirectories.
eslint.config.js
index.html
package.json
statistics.html
tile-editor.html
timeline.html
tsconfig.json
vite.config.ts
src/apps/main/
src/assets/
src/core
src/gui
src/types

For this analysis please skip these files since they are not relevant for the current tasks:
src/core/utils/solver-cairo-pentagons-sorted.test.ts
src/core/utils/solver-cairo-pentagons-unsorted.test.ts
src/core/utils/solver-convex-concave-impossible.test.ts
src/core/utils/solver-types.ts
src/core/utils/solver.ts


## POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS
* i might want to skip the solver next time
* next time: "please familiarize yourself with these files and directories in the cwd" 
* 79% context left (with solver)
