Please look at:
scripts/create-project-statistics.ts
vite.config.ts
statistics.html
src/apps/statistics

then please also include the excludedFolders and excludedFiles in the generated json and show them to the user so it is clear to him what files are not part of the statistics.


The intended logic is this:
* Include all files that are not ignored by git. So it should not make any difference if
* keep handling of excludedFolders/excludedFiles just like it is
